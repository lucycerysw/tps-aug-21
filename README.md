# Ideas

- Use Nested Cross Validation to tune Hyperparameters (https://machinelearningmastery.com/nested-cross-validation-for-machine-learning-with-python/)
- Note to Munum: on it


- Neural Networks either built manually or through AutoKeras
- - Working on trying to get TPU's working with the above so its super fast

- use `imblearn` package to deal with the class imbalance
